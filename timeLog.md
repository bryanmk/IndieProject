| 1/25 | Build core of project and connect to github                                                          | 3    | poked around for a bit just getting used to the environment here as well                                                                         |
| 1/26 | edit web.xml, pom.xml, add readme.md and timelog.md                                                  | 1    | figured out how to make this neat table                                                                                                          |
| 2/9  | setup battlenet developer account and gained access to api's                                         | 1    | now have mfa and tokens to use to sign in every session                                                                                          |
| 2/9  | setup questie database, created quest and user tables. Created quest and user javabeans and packages | 2    | still need to make a test database                                                                                                               |
| 2/10 | copied over everything in the resources directory from week-2 display exercise                       | 1    |                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2/10 | working on setting up hibernate and dao classes with unit testing                                    | 2    |                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2/10 | Got through testing User class and deploying app, but can't get search results                       | 3    | sql grammar exception could not extract result set                                                                                               |
| 2/11 | Fixed user search results, refactored jsp's to also have quests search option on index               | 3    | all quest stuff not tested yet                                                                                                                   |
| 2/12 | Built all of the test database for quests, built questDaoTest class and got everything working       | 2    | just have exercise css format for now, will pretty everything up at some point, but for now I'm going for functionality and its lookin good      |
| 2/16 | Figured out more or less how to get oauth tokens and use battlenet api's                             | 2    |                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2/17 | Got all quest-related api's into their own directories                                               | 2    | thought a good amount of how to build out project. I think not using any of my own databases would be preferred.                                 |
| 2/24 | No idea how to work with new POJO's, Paula said lots to learn there in weeks 8/9                     | 2    | Not sure what to do from here, so I didn't really touch the project this week                                                                    |
| 3/31 | Home was ravaged by disease and it took everything I had just to keep up with weekly work            | 0    | Luckily I had worked through week 8 in week 4 and implemented that into the project already, otherwise I'd be toast                              |
| 4/7  | Studied Oauth and api's a lot this week                                                              | 6    | Don't understand this stuff, need to keep studying                                                                                               |
| 4/14 | Found a couple of repositories of people who have done similar-ish work to study                     | 4    | Nothing in Java, difficult to interpret and still don't understand Oauth                                                                         |
| 4/21 | Found videos of a guy working with battlenet api's specifically                                      | 3    | He works in PHP, so this really wasn't as helpful as I thought. I still learned a bunch though which is fun                                      |
| 4/28 | Asked wife's coworkers, IT dept, about Oauth and they helped me understand headers                   | 9    | Spent a lot of time learning from industry professionals about oauth, they helped a ton, but again not Java specific. I use insomnia now though  |
| 4/30 | Really dug into the API's this weekend to figure out what's where and how I can use it               | 6    | There is so much in Battlenet API's that I think I spent most of the semester so far just being overwhelmed. Finally starting to grasp it all    |
| 5/3  | Major breakthrough! Finally figured out how to acquire new token for every API call                  | 3    | Can now call API successfully no matter what, no more token expirations throwing 401 errors                                                      |
| 5/4  | My whole world came crashing down as my VM decided to stop working and so did my backup              | 7    | VM no longer had internet. Same issue with the backup, will continue tomorrow                                                                    |
| 5/5  | Created entirely new VM from scratch, and it ended up having the same error                          | 9    | Started downloading software on host machine, will try to set that up tomorrow                                                                   |
| 5/6  | I think I got my host machine all good to go, can finally start working again                        | 6    | This process was difficult simply because I had to figure out all of the setup for Windows. Been in Linux for the last year                      |
| 5/7  | After about 24 hours of worktime wasted/lost I can finally deploy again, just toying around with API | 4    | Figuring out how to go about the API calls to be most effective/efficient in my app                                                              |
| 5/8  | Had to troubleshoot database not updating on AWS. Forgot it is actually a separate database          | 11   | Decided not to call API every time, instead pulling things into my own database                                                                  |
| 5/9  | Continued pulling more quests into database. Can't upload new war file to AWS. Hope is lost          | 12   | I finally got to the point where I could really start implementing the features that I have wanted this whole time, and now the semester is over |
