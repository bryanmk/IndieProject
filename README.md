# Matt Bryan Individual Project

This repository will contain my project to create a quest helper web application for World of Warcraft (WoW) classic.

### Problem Statement

In WoW classic you receive an immense amount of quests with nothing but a vague description to go on. It can take eons to figure out where you need to go and specifically what you need to do in order to complete quests.

My goal is to create an interactive website that will help you on your way when you become stuck on a quest.

#### [TimeLog](timeLog.md)

I've spent over 100 hours this semester working on this project. Most of that time has been spent researching relevant topics and troubleshooting things when they didn't work how I thought they would.
