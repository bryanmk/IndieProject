# Matt Bryan Individual Project

This repository will contain my project to create a quest helper web application for World of Warcraft (WoW) classic.

### Problem Statement

In WoW classic you receive an immense amount of quests with nothing but a vague description to go on. It can take eons to figure out where you need to go and specifically what you need to do in order to complete quests.
